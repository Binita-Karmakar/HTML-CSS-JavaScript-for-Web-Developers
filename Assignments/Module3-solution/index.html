  		<p class="content-name">Vegetables</p>
  		<p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original meaning is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, leaves, roots & seeds. The alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary & cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts & cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses. Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers & entered cultivation in several parts of the world, when a new agricultural way of life developed.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

   		<p class="content-name">Fish</p>
   		<p>This article is about fish as food for humans. For sealife in general as food, see seafood. For fish fed to other fish, see commercial fish feed and aquarium fish feed. Fish stuffed with Thai herbs. Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world. Fish has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history. English does not have a special culinary name for food prepared from these animals, as it does with pig vs. pork, and as does Spanish pescado vs. pez. In culinary and fishery contexts, fish may include shellfish, such as molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms; more expansively, seafood covers both fish and other marine life used as food.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

  		<p class="content-name">Chicken</p>
  		<p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
